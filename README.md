#HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNIZER

📖 Overview

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.
It serves as a hands-on example of applying deep learning techniques to solve computer vision problems.

⚙ Requirements

Before running the project, install the dependencies:

pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone <repo_link>
cd handwritten-digit-cnn

2️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

3️⃣ Run the Notebook

Open mnist_digit_cnn.ipynb

Execute all cells in sequence to:

Load & preprocess data

Train CNN model

Test and evaluate performance

📊 Model Performance

Achieved ~98% test accuracy.

Successfully recognizes digits 0–9 with high precision.
